// What we need to do:
 // 1. Set up a function to call. It should have the "search term" passed into it (function variable). To test the function perhaps have it bring up an alert with the value passed in. Then set an onclick event handler on the button to run the function.
 // 2. Have the function search through each row of the "sportname" array looking for the search term.
 // 3. If it finds a match run an alert that tells about the sport like:
 //   alert('The sport ' + sportname[i] + ' is played with a ' + sportobject[i] + ' inside a ' + sportarena[i] + ' and is won by scoring more ' + sportpoint[i] + ' than the other team.'
 // 4. Finally further test the app by adding one more row to each array for another sport, and try searching for that one.
