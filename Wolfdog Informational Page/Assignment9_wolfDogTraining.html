        <h1>WolfDog Training Techniques</h1>
        
        
		<h3 id="ar" class="title">Positive Reinforcement as Training</h3>
		<div id="ar-content" class="content">
			<p>Wolfdogs respond VERY well to positive reinforcement. Use positive methods and praise to teach. Then you will create within your animal a desire to please and to seek positive feedback/attention. Wolfdogs (and dogs) respond poorly to negative reinforcement. Controlling a canine through fear is not being in control of your animal. It is being a tyrant, and people rebel against tyrants. Can any blame a canid for doing the same if given the opportunity? A fair and trustworthy master is necessary for a well behaved, well trained, and well adjusted animal.</p>
        </div>
            
        <h3  class="title">Reprimanding</h3>        
		<div  class="content">
			<p>Wolfdogs are sensitive to voice and usually require just a loud, in-command voice. If you are seriously reprimanding him, he will probably tuck his tail between his legs or wrap his tail around the side of his rear leg toward his belly. A more serious reprimand may result in your pet rolling over onto his back, exposing his neck and belly. This signals his complete submission to your authority. (You may also see him do this with other dogs until he gets a little bigger.) Lying with his belly exposed is his last resort; STOP reprimanding. If you were to continue, it would only confuse him. He is responding in his language and you must respond to him in kind. Just walk away from him.
                
                <br><br>

After being reprimanded, the wolfdog will probably want to apologize. Let him. He will do this by coming up to you with his tail and his head lowered and with ears flattened somewhat to the side, and he will then begin licking your chin. Let him. This is VERY important. It lets him know that you forgive/love him, making the bonds that much stronger.</p>		
		</div>
        
        <h3  class="title">Bite Inhibition Training</h3>        
		<div  class="content">
			<p>This was somewhat mentioned above in training a canid not to be food aggressive. This can be taught not only with food, however. When the animal has something in his mouth, reach in and take it away. Then praise the animal when he lets you do it and return the item to the animal. Continue doing this throughout the life of the animal.  <br><br>

When the animal is very small or is teething, he might also decide to chew on the pants, shoes, etc. that you are wearing. Do NOT let him. Remove the object from his mouth and tell him no. This will not work by itself, but it begins teaching the animal "NO". When the pup repeats the chewing act, , wrap your arm over and around pup; take your finger and insert it into the pup's mouth from the rear side, with your finger pointing toward the back of his throat--your arm is coming from around and behind the pup's head and your finger/hand is going into the back side of the mouth. With your finger down the back of his throat, the pup's gag reflex will be triggered. Make sure the animal does not see that it is your finger causing the gag reflex you will be triggering. The theory here is that every time the animal bites something he isn't supposed to, he will (for some reason he can't figure out) begin gagging. After repeatedly doing this every time he attempts to chew what he isn't supposed to, the animal will then begin to associate biting "no-no" items with gagging; therefore, the animal thinks, "If I bite what I am not supposed to, I gag! No fun there!"  <br><br>

With a larger canine, a different approach is necessary. When the canine mouths you, insert your thumb into the bottom of his mouth with your thumb pressing down on the soft part of the mouth under the tongue. At the same time, your fingers should be curled under the canine's chin, applying slight pressure to the chin. In other words, your thumb and fingers should be pressing toward each other, with the canine's chin between your thumb and fingers. While doing this, follow up on the verbal command of "No Bite!" or "Off" or some such command that you will use throughout the life of your animal. Most canines will react by pushing at your thumb with his tongue and trying to pull his lower jaw out of your grip. After a few times of doing this, the canine will eventually realize that mouthing people results in this reprimand, and the animal will then learn to keep its mouth off of people. This is a painless and highly successful way of teaching bite inhibition to older canines who haven't been taught it as pups. It is also a way of reinforcing bite inhibition to pups who have been trained, should such training need to be reinforced.

        <h3  class="title">Food Aggression Training</h3>        
		<div  class="content">
			Some canids tend to be pigs over food. This behavior can manifest itself into a food aggressive animal. Many bites occur over someone (especially children) trying to take food or a toy from the canid. As a responsible owner, you MUST deter this behavior while they are puppies.
            <br><br>
            Though the above is an excellent policy and should be implemented so that a food aggression occurrence does not occur, a "better safe than sorry" policy is even better. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) cautions that small children NOT be allowed unsupervised around any animal while it is eating! Actually, the AVMA cautions that children should NEVER be allowed around large canines without proper supervision. This is due, in large part, to the rising bite statistics in children in the U.S. (One of every three children has been bitten by a dog.) Most bites occur either with the child's dog or with the neighbor's dog and occur in large part because children are not properly educated about dogs.
		</div>
        
        <h3  class="title">Teething/Chewing Training</h3>        
		<div  class="content">
			<p>If the pup has chewed or teethed on something he shouldn't have, then you need to tell the pup to come to you. Again, do NOT chase the puppy down. Let him come to you. (See the training technique above.) Hold the offending item in your hands and visible to the pup, and place an item that the pup can chew somewhere within reaching distance. Then hold up the chewed item and tell the pup "NO" in a firm voice. (During all this time, you should also have been training the animal what "NO" and "Chew Toy" (or Toy) are.) Tell him this is "NO Chew Toy!" in a strong tone and then pick up his toy and say "<Name of animal> Chew Toy". They will then understand what they can chew as opposed to what they cannot. Unfortunately, it may take a number of "no chew toy" items to successfully accomplish the objective of not having the animal chew up that which is not his to chew. <grin> That is all part of owning a canid, regardless of size or breed. But with PLENTY of chew toys, lots of exercise, and proper training, the number of "no chew toy" items that fall prey to your pup will diminish and then finally end. <br><br>

With problem chewing, we found one successful and painless method. I will share the story with you in case it may help others who have experienced something similar and don't know what to do about it. We had a one-year-old rescue come to us one day. This animal had not been trained or socialized, so she stayed inside with us so we could work on her socialization and ease her into her new home. We just didn't realize that she would show such a keen interest in leather. She went through two purses, my husband's wallet, and about a dozen shoes. After the fifth or sixth pair of shoes and none of the training methods working with this animal, we were ready to throw our hands up in despair. Instead, I got so disgusted that I finally said to myself, "If she wants them so badly, then she can have them." <br><br>

So my husband and I decided to spend the weekend at home, working on her "leather" training. Friday evening I strange three pairs of those mangled shoes (six shoes) onto a choke chain, which I then attached to her collar. The shoes were hanging down between her front legs. Every time she walked, the shoes would sway from side to side like a pendulum, knocking her in the knees. She wore these shoes for two days--from Friday night until Sunday afternoon. Every time she made a move to mouth those shoes, my husband or I would reprimand her. Finally she got so disgusted with having to waddle around with these shoes batting against her front legs that she would knock them out of the way with an irritated kick and lay down very quickly before the shoes had time to swing back toward her. She didn't do much but lay around the second 24-hour period. The result is that she now goes out of her way to avoid shoes, easing around them when she can or disgustedly kicking them out of the way when they are left on the bedroom floor and it is time for us to go to bed. Needless to say, we haven't had any more shoe casualties here.   <br><br>

        <h3  class="title">Teaching The "Come" Command</h3>        
		<div  class="content">
Wolfdogs are pretty good about wanting to stay near their owners (their pack leaders). This is an easy command to teach a puppy. Many dog owners have serious problems with this command, however. And it could arise from two different reasons: the puppy was not trained or the owner played the "chase the animal" game. If the owner refuses to play the game, then the animal is more likely to come when called, even if they know they are in trouble for something.  <br><br>

Begin the training as a small puppy, if possible. Use food as an incentive initially on getting the animal to come. Praise the animal when he comes, and he will then begin learning the "come" command and learning that it pleases you when he comes. <br><br>

Progress to training the pup while it is on a leash. You can even extend the leash to a rather long lead if you feel it necessary. Keep the animal leashed and do not remove or release the leash during this stage in training. Once this stage has been completed successfully, move to the next stage. <br><br>

Progress to taking the animal on walks and letting the leash (not a lead) drag periodically. If the animal continues walking farther away from you, then tell him come. If he comes, continue practicing and move to more populated areas where there is more activity. If he ignores you, then turn around telling him "COME" and begin walking in the other direction. The animal will then become a little confused that YOU are leaving HIM and will probably come running after you. If he does not, then begin running away from your pup. The animal will then become a little concerned and will more than likely begin running after you. When he gets to you, pick up the leash and continue walking. Provide neither praise nor reprimand. Just continue the walk. <br><br>

Once you have successfully conquered this step, move to more populated areas with more activity. Repeat the steps in the previous paragraph, praising the animal when he comes on command and walking away from him when he fails to come. <br><br>

Chasing a puppy is one of the worst mistakes an owner can make. With the exception of an emergency, do NOT chase after your puppy. You will then begin playing a game of tag that you will probably lose every time. You will also be undoing some of the training you have thus far accomplished.	 <br><br>
